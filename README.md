# Monitor-Calibration-Profiles
Archival and sharing of my calibration profiles

## Measurement Conditions
Hardware: Spyder5Express

Software: Displaycal 3.8.9.3

Gamma: 2.2

White point: 6500K

Observer: CIE 2012 2 Degrees

### General rules of thumb
I'm not working with prints or any other professional colour-related work. This is just for gaming & media enjoyment.

There may also be unit-to-unit variance, so my profiles may not be perfect for you. YMMV.

Hence, I calibrate to 2012-2 rather than the still-standard 1932-2.

I calibrate to a brightness of 150 cd/m2. Calibration curves may vary when brightness is adjusted.

All "dynamic" settings, such as auto-dimming, power saving, low blue light, etc.etc. should be turned off.
